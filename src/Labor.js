On appeal,  the NLRC reversed the ruling because Article 4 of the Labor Code  - which states that all doubts  in the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Labor Code, including the implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved  in favor of labor - applied  only when  the doubt  involved  the `implementation and interpretation`  of the Labor Code; hence, the doubt,  which  involved  the  application of the  rules  on  evidence, not  the  Labor  Code,  could  not necessarily be resolved in favor of Procopio.

Ricardo charged its clients a 10% service charge and distributed  85%   of  the  collection  equally  among  its  rank-and-file  employees,  10%  among managerial employees, and 5% as reserve for losses and break ages.  Because of the huge volume of sales,  the employees received sizeable shares in the collected service charges.As  part  of his   business  development  efforts,  Ricardo  opened  a  branch  in   Cebu  where  he maintained the same practice in  the collection and distribution  of service charges.  The Cebu branch,  however,  did  not attract the  forecasted clientele;  hence, the Cebu employees received lesser service charge benefits than those enjoyed by the Makati-based employees. As a result, the Cebu branch employees demanded equalization of benefits and filed  a case  with  the NLRC  for discrimination when Ricardo refused their demand.Will the  case  prosper?  (2013 Bar  Question)a.    Yes, because the employees are not receiving equal treatment in the distribution of service charge benefits.b.

No, because the employees in  Makati are  not  similarly situated as the Cebu employees with  respect to cost  of living and  conditions of work.d.

Both  the 2001 POEA• SEC and the CBA commonly provide  that the same  mode  and procedures for claiming disability benefits. Cesar's last contract  (for nine months) expired  on July 15, 2013.Cesar disembarked  from  the vessel M/V Seven Seas  on July  16, 2013 as  a seaman on  `finished contract`. He  immediately reported to the agency and complained that  he had  been experiencing spells of dizziness, nausea, general weakness, and  difficulty in breathing. The agency referred to him  to Dr.  Sales,  a cardio-pulmonary specialist, who  examined and treated him;  advised him  to take  a complete rest  for a while; gave  him  medications; and declared him  fit to resume work as a seaman.After a month,  Cesar went  back  to the agency to ask for re-deployment. The  agency  rejected his application. Cesar responded by demanding total disability benefits  based  on the ailments  that he developed and  suffered  while  on  board  Meritt  Shipping vessels.  The  claim  was  based   on  the certification of his physician (internist  Dr.  Reyes)  that he could  no longer  undertake  sea  duties because of the  hypertension and  diabetes that  afflicted him  while  serving  on  Meritt  Shipping vessels in the last 10 years.  Rejected once  again,  Cesar filed  a complaint for illegal dismissal and the payment of total permanent disability benefits  against  the agency  and its principal.Assume that you are the Labor Arbiter deciding the case.  Identify  the facts  and issues you would consider material in resolving the illegal dismissal and disability complaint. Explain your choices and their materiality,  and resolve the case.

    "text": "  The  modes of determining the exclusive bargaining agent  of the employees in a business are:a.    voluntary recognition;b.    certification election; and c.    consent election.Explain how they differ from one  another.  (2012 Bar Question) SUGGESTED  ANSWER:(a)  Voluntary  Recognition: An  employer  may voluntarily  recognize  the representation status  of a labor union  if  the  establishment  is  unorganized   and  has  only  one  legitimate  labor  organization.  Such voluntary  recognition, accompanied  by supporting documents, should  be submitted to the Regional Office, which issued the labor union's certificate of registration.UPDATED ANSWER:_Voluntary  recognition  by the employer  is no  longer  sanctioned  by the LaborCode and its Rules. The labor union must instead seek SEBA Certification.NOTE: This has already been repealed by DO  No. 40-I-15 which instituted  a procedure  for a request  for certification  as SEBA.(b)  Certification  Election:  This  is the process  by which  a legitimate labor  organization  or the employer may file a petition for certification election to determine  the choice of an exclusive collective bargaining agent of the employees. A med-arbiter shall automatically order a certification  election by secret ballot when a petition is filed (1) in an unorganized  establishment or (2) in an organized establishment where the  petition  is supported   by at least  25%  of all employees  in  the bargaining  unit.  To  have  a valid certification  election, at least a majority of all eligible votes in the bargaining unit must have cast their votes. The labor union receiving the majority of the valid votes cast shall be certified as the exclusive bargaining agent of all employees in the unit.(c)  Consent  Election:  Similar  to a certification  election  proceeding,  consent  election  is the process  of determining   through   secret  ballot   the  sole  and  exclusive  bargaining   agent  of employees  in  an appropriate  collective  bargaining  unit  for  purposes   of collective  bargaining  or  negotiations.  This process, however, differs  from a certification  election as this is voluntarily agreed upon  by the parties,59with or without  the DOLE's intervention. In such a case, the med-arbiter need not issue a formal order calling for such an election.  The  minutes  of the agreement  and records  of the case are forwarded  to the Regional Director for implementation of the consent  election."

Mario  Brothers engaged the services  of Tristan, Arthur, and Jojo as plumber,  pipe fitter, and threader, respectively. These workers have worked  for Mario Brothers in numerous construction projects  in the past but because of their long relationship, they were  never asked to  sign  contracts for each project.  No reports to government agencies were  made regarding their work  in the  company.During the implementation of the works contract, Axis  suffered financial difficulties and was  not able  to pay Mario Brothers its past billings. As a result, the three (3) employees were  not paid their91salaries  for two  (2) months  and their 13th month  pay.

Explain.  (2.5%)SUGGETED ANSWER:No.   The  requirements  to qualify an employment as project-based  was set by the Supreme  Court  in one cas eas follows:1)     employers  claiming that their workers  are project  employees  should not only prove  that the duration and scope of the employment was specified at the time they were engaged, but also that there was indeed a project; and2)     the termination  of the project must be reported  by the employer to the DOLE Regional Office having jurisdiction over  the workplace  within  the period  prescribed,  and  failure  to do  so militates  against  the employer's  claim of project employment.   This is true even outside  the construction industry.Mario Brothers  failed to comply with both  requirements; hence,  Tristan, Arthur  and Jojo  are its regular employees.  The cancellation  of its contract  with Axis did not result to the termination  of employment of Tristan, Arthur  and Jojo.  [GMA  NetJvork, Inc v.  Pabriga,  (G.R.

Why is this statement an inaccurate  statement of the law?  (2011 Bar Question)128a.    Because the power to inspect applies only to employer records, not  to the premises.b.    Because only the  Secretary of Labor and  Employment has  the power to inspect,  and  such power cannot be delegated.c.    Because the law allows  inspection anytime of the day or night, not only during work hours. d.

During the negotiations for their expired collective bargaining agreement (CBA),  the parties duly served their proposals  and   counter-proposals  on  one  another.
